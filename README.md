It is a Mancala playing agent, which will give their steps calculating all the probable outcomes we will make different heuristic functions for different machines to compete them each other We will make a class which will be the competition class, which will arrange competition between different type of agents We will also make a Mancala AI class which will be responsible for playing and determining the next step for it The mancala AI class will contain almost every information about the agent playing While creating the instance for the mancala AI class, we will start them with the parameter of what type of heuristics we want to calcualte We will use them as the instance set up earlier IN the mancala AI class, we will need to use nodes for creating a tree liek object We have to create a separate class for that tree We can add some necessary information about the node as its elements Also, we have to select W1,W2,W3.... values when creating the mancala AI class We also have to determine the value of the depth we want to search at one step We may have to calcualte them manually We also have to tune out AI to find the most effective W values to get We can do that by iterating and arranging competitions between all of them it may be morte helpful, but also time consuming We have to calculate alpha and the beta values of the nodes of the tree We have to calculate the max values in alpha node and the min values in the beta node
